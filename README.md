## Usage 

### Prerequisites
To use this tool you'll need:
   1. Qualcomm Product Support Tools (QPST - we used version 2.7.437 running on a windows 10 machine)
   2. A Cross compiler to build the payload for the devices (we used [arm-eabi-4.6](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/prebuilts/gcc/linux-x86/arm/arm-eabi-4.6/) toolchain for aarch32 and [aarch64-linux-android-4.8](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/prebuilts/gcc/linux-x86/aarch64/aarch64-linux-android-4.8/) toolchain for aarch64, both running on ubuntu 16.04 machine). <b>On debian</b>: apt install gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu gcc-arm-none-eabi.
 Â  3. Acquire the relevant programmers and copy them to the host/target/device directory


### Building the payloads
First, edit the Makefile in the device directory - set the device variable to whatever device you want (nokia6, angler, ugglite, mido and cheeseburger are currently supported).
<br/>
<br/>
Next, set the CROSS_COMPILE_32 and CROSS_COMPILE_64 enviroment vars as follows:
```
export CROSS_COMPILE_32=<path-to-arm-eabi-4.6-toolchain>/bin/arm-eabi-
export CROSS_COMPILE_64=<path-to-aarch64-linux-android-4.8-toolchain>/bin/aarch64-linux-android-
```
Then call make and the payload for your specific device will be built

### Configure the tool 
Before we start, we need to configure some stuff, edit the constants.py file in the host directory:
  1. set COM to whatever com port the device is connnected to
  2. set FH_LOADER with a path to the fh_loader.exe  in the QPST\bin directory
  3. set SAHARA_SERVER with a path to the QSaharaServer.exe  in the QPST\bin directory

```python
COM = "COM17"
FH_LOADER = r"C:\Program Files (x86)\Qualcomm\QPST437\bin\fh_loader.exe"
SAHARA_SERVER = r"C:\Program Files (x86)\Qualcomm\QPST437\bin\QSaharaServer.exe" 
```
